WRITING SAMPLE:
THE FLAME TAMER

Once upon a time, there was a flame that burned uncontrollably.
Full of emotion, desire and often misunderstood, travelled with very few companions but still managed to feel alone.
One day, she met cool breeze, he pursued the flame, they seeming different attracted instantly to each other.
Cool breeze was the embodiment of strength, beauty and gentleness.
For weeks their essences intertwined together creating memories the flame will always remember.
